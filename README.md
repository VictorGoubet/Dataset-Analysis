SkillCraft is a dataset composed of a lot of features of over three thousand players playing at StarCraft 2 from bronze to professional gamers. In our study we will try to predict the league index of a player considering all his others features. Thus, it is a **classification problem.**

In our notebook we have followed the next steps:
- Data exploration 
- Data engeneering
- Modeling
- Optimisation (Tunning)
- Conclusion

We obtain finally a score of **0.45** due to a sgnificant lack of data espacially for the level 8 players.
A flask API is available to make prediction on your datas if you want.

You can read the powerpoint which resume quickly the main problems, steps and reflexions we encountered.
The notebook, being well commented, is self-sufficient.
